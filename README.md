# Hotel Booking System - Unit Testing Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive unit testing strategy for the Hotel Booking System's core business logic. We've implemented a robust testing framework that ensures 100% test coverage of the `HotelBooking.Core` project while following modern testing best practices.

## Key Testing Improvements

### 1. Removed Legacy Testing Approach
- **Eliminated Fake Repositories**: Completely removed fake repository implementations that were tightly coupled to the production code
- **Eliminated Fake Services**: Replaced fake service implementations with proper mocking using Moq
- **Benefits**: This separation ensures true unit testing isolation and prevents test coupling with implementation details

### 2. Modern Mocking with Moq Framework
We use **Moq 4.20.72** for all dependency mocking, providing:
- **Clean Isolation**: Each test focuses purely on the unit under test
- **Flexible Setup**: Easy configuration of mock behavior for different test scenarios
- **Verification**: Ability to verify that dependencies are called correctly

```csharp
// Example: Mocking repository dependencies
var mockBookingRepo = new Mock<IRepository<Booking>>();
var mockRoomRepo = new Mock<IRepository<Room>>();
mockBookingRepo.Setup(r => r.GetAllAsync()).ReturnsAsync(testBookings);
```

### 3. Fluent Assertions for Readable Tests
We use **FluentAssertions 8.6.0** throughout our test suite because:
- **Improved Readability**: Tests read like natural language, making them easier to understand and maintain
- **Better Error Messages**: When tests fail, the error messages are descriptive and helpful
- **Maintainability**: Code reviews and debugging are significantly easier

```csharp
// Instead of: Assert.Equal(-1, roomId);
// We use: roomId.Should().Be(-1);

// More complex assertions:
result.Should().NotBeNull();
result.Should().BeOfType<List<DateTime>>();
result.Should().HaveCount(3);
```

### 4. Organized Test Structure
Our tests are logically organized in a clear folder hierarchy:

```
HotelBooking.UnitTests/
├── Entities/                    # Entity validation tests
│   ├── BookingTests.cs         # Tests for Booking entity
│   ├── CustomerTests.cs        # Tests for Customer entity
│   └── RoomTests.cs            # Tests for Room entity
├── Services/
│   └── BookingManager/         # Business logic tests
│       ├── CreateBookingTests.cs        # 7 tests for booking creation
│       ├── FindAvailableRoomTests.cs    # 7 tests for room availability
│       └── GetFullyOccupiedDatesTests.cs # 7 tests for occupancy queries
└── Controllers/                # API endpoint tests
    └── RoomsControllerTests.cs
```

### 5. Complete Core Coverage
- **100% Test Coverage**: Every class in `HotelBooking.Core` has corresponding unit tests
- **Entity Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all domain entities (Booking, Customer, Room) to ensure proper property behavior and validation
- **Business Logic Tests**: Thorough testing of all BookingManager methods with various scenarios
- **Consistent Test Count**: Each service test class contains exactly 7 focused tests covering critical scenarios

### 6. Test Data Generation with Bogus
We use **Bogus 3.6.3** for generating realistic test data:
- **Realistic Data**: Creates more meaningful test scenarios
- **Randomization**: Helps discover edge cases through varied data
- **Maintainability**: Reduces hardcoded test data that can become outdated

## Testing Framework Stack
- **xUnit 2.9.3**: Modern, lightweight testing framework
- **Moq 4.20.72**: Powerful mocking framework for dependency isolation
- **FluentAssertions 8.6.0**: Readable and maintainable assertions
- **Bogus 3.6.3**: Realistic test data generation

## Known Technical Debt
### Hardcoded DateTime Usage
Currently, our tests use `DateTime.Today` and `DateTime.Today.AddDays()` for date calculations:

```csharp
DateTime startDate = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1);
DateTime endDate = DateTime.Today.AddDays(3);
```

**Why this is problematic**:
- Tests may pass today but fail tomorrow due to changing dates
- Makes tests non-deterministic and harder to debug
- Can cause CI/CD pipeline failures

**Future improvement**: We plan to implement a `IDateTimeProvider` interface and inject it into our services, allowing us to control time in tests and make them deterministic.

## Test Examples

### Business Logic Testing
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task CreateBooking_ValidBooking_ReturnsTrue()
{
    // Arrange
    var booking = CreateBookingWithDates(
        DateTime.Today.AddDays(1), 
        DateTime.Today.AddDays(3));
    
    SetupAvailableRoom(booking.StartDate, booking.EndDate);
    
    // Act
    bool result = await bookingManager.CreateBooking(booking);
    
    // Assert
    result.Should().BeTrue();
    bookingRepository.Verify(r => r.AddAsync(booking), Times.Once);
}
```

### Entity Testing
```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData(1, 101, 201, true)]
[InlineData(2, 102, 202, false)]
public void Booking_PropertiesCanBeSet_Correctly(int id, int customerId, int roomId, bool isActive)
{
    // Arrange & Act
    var booking = new Booking
    {
        Id = id,
        CustomerId = customerId,
        RoomId = roomId,
        IsActive = isActive
    };
    
    // Assert
    booking.Id.Should().Be(id);
    booking.CustomerId.Should().Be(customerId);
    booking.RoomId.Should().Be(roomId);
    booking.IsActive.Should().Be(isActive);
}
```

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Isolation**: True unit testing with no dependencies on external systems
2. **Maintainability**: Clear, readable tests that are easy to modify and understand
3. **Reliability**: Consistent test structure with comprehensive coverage
4. **Speed**: Fast test execution due to proper mocking
5. **Quality**: High confidence in code changes through comprehensive test coverage
